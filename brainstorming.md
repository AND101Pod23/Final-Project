App Description: FitTube is a fitness platform that acts as a fitness equivalence of YouTube. In doing so, it creates a new perspective to seeing a video platform as a way to promote physical health improvement rather than reduce it in features like infinite scrolling and mindless viewing. We plan to give people a space to easily locate the best exercise videos for their health and track their progress with ease.
