Project Spec:

App Overview: 

The first page is the login page, where users can input their username and password to login. After logging in, they would be able to see their stats of how much they have worked out over the week. Users can dismiss the page, by clicking “Got it!” and it would lead to their profile page. In their profile page, users can see their name, date of birth, weight, and the ideal weight that they are targeting. After their information, users have two options. They can either view their stats again or they can choose to exercise now. Under the two options, users can see their calendar view of what is the ideal workout that they should be completing today. When users click “Exercise now”, they have multiple options to see what they would like to work out today. Based on what they have chosen, the Youtube API should filter videos tailor to what the users would like to workout to. When a video is chosen, they would be able to view the video and the stats that would increase after they have completed the video.
